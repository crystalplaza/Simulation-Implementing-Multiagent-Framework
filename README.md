# **Simulations Based Multiagent-Framework**
- **Simulations** are created: 
   - **Flocking**
     <br />In flocking, the agents are birds. Each bird has a random heading and a random speed. A bird will copy its speed and heading to his neighbor's speed and heading if a 
     neighbor is within certain distance.
   - **Random Walks**
     <br />In random Walk, agents are drunks. They update themselves by selecting a random heading and random number of steps.
   - **Plague**
     <br />The plague agents are population. The healthy people is green. If a people get infected by a virus, the color will changed into red. It simulator models the spread 
     of a virus through a population.
   
   - **Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament**
     <br />In Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament agents are prisoners. Each prisoner has a fitness score, which is initially zero. A prisoner updates itself by playing a game of prisoner's 
     dilemma with a random neighbor. In this game each prisoner decides to cooperate or cheat.
   - **SugarScape**
     <br /> The agents in SugarScape are hungry ants. They roam aroundlooking for sugar. When an ant discovers a patch of sugar, he consumes it and resumes his search for more sugar.
     It's size will grow bigger, and its fitness becomes bigger.
   - **Traffic**
     <br />The agents are cars in traffic. A car has speed and heading. To avoid traffic, if there is a car within certain distance of another car, the car will heading to the opposite
     direction of the coming car.
- **Patterns** are used:
  - **Model-View-Controller Pattern**
  - **Multiagent-Anget Pattern**
  - **Strategy**
